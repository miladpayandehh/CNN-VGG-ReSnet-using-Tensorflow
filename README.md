# CNN-VGG-ResNet-using-Tensorflow
**A convolutional neural network (CNN)** is a type of artificial neural network used primarily for image recognition and processing, due to its ability to recognize patterns in images.

**VGG** stands for Visual Geometry Group; it is a standard deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture with multiple layers. The “deep” refers to the number of layers with VGG-16 or VGG-19 consisting of 16 and 19 convolutional layers.

**Residual Network (ResNet)** is a deep learning model used for computer vision applications. It is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture designed to support hundreds or thousands of convolutional layers.

**TensorFlow** is an end-to-end open-source platform for machine learning. TensorFlow is a rich system for managing all aspects of a machine learning system; however, this class focuses on using a particular TensorFlow API to develop and train machine learning models.
